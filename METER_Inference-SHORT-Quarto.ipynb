    "### What is Inference?\n",
    "\n",
    "Inference is a fundamental concept in both everyday life and scientific investigation. It is the process of drawing conclusions based on evidence and reasoning. Inference allows us to make predictions, understand relationships, and gain insights from data and observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Inference Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decision-Making**: Inference helps us make informed decisions. Whether you're deciding what to wear based on the weather forecast or determining the best strategy for your experiment, inference plays a crucial role in evaluating options and outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understanding Brain Function**: Inference helps neuroscientists draw conclusions about brain activity from experimental data, bridging the gap between observed neural signals and underlying brain processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clinical Applications**: Inference is essential for diagnosing and treating neurological disorders. By analyzing patient data, clinicians can infer the underlying causes of symptoms and tailor treatments accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Everyday Examples of Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weather Predictions**: Meteorologists use data from satellites, weather stations, and historical patterns to infer future weather conditions. This helps us prepare for what’s coming, whether it's bringing an umbrella or planning for a sunny day.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Medical Diagnoses**: Doctors use symptoms, medical history, and test results to infer the most likely cause of a patient's condition. This process is critical in providing accurate diagnoses and effective treatments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Electrophysiology**: Recording electrical activity from neurons allows researchers to infer the roles of specific neurons or networks in processing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Behavioral Studies**: By observing behavior in response to stimuli, neuroscientists infer the neural mechanisms underlying perception, decision-making, and learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So, what is Inference?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, we focus on **statistical inference** - using data from a sample to make inferences about a population. We will learn to apply statistical inference in this Unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inference Skills To Develop\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ask Questions**: Cultivate curiosity by asking questions about the world around you. Why did something happen? What might influence this happening? Asking questions leads to deeper understanding and better inference skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gather Evidence**: Collect relevant information and data. The more evidence you have, the stronger your inferences will be. Evaluate the quality and reliability of your sources. We can arrive at better conclusions through better data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Think Critically**: Analyze the evidence and consider multiple perspectives. Avoid jumping to conclusions without thorough examination. Critical thinking helps in making sound inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's next?\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this Unit, we will practice making inferences from from noisy data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- To do so, we will use data from a specific example. We will build models from these data to make inferences about a population (i.e., statistical inference).\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will think critically about our inference results, ask questions about the interpretation (i.e., check our model), and update our model to improve the inferences we make from the data."
