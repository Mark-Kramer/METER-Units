    "text": "Based on the groundbreaking research previously conducted in your lab, you and your collaborators have formulated a compelling scientific hypothesis: substance \\(x\\) could be a genetic biomarker for longevity, potentially influencing the age at which individuals pass away. This intriguing hypothesis opens up a new frontier in our understanding of genetics and lifespan, promising significant advancements in the field.\nBefore we can embark on an experimental journey to test the predictive power of this novel biomarker, we must first tackle a critical step: determining the appropriate sample size for a follow-up research study. The sample size is not just a number; it is a cornerstone of experimental design that ensures our data will be robust enough to support or refute our hypothesis.\nTo accurately compute this sample size, we need to consider our prior beliefs and existing knowledge about substance \\(x\\) and its relationship to longevity. Let’s delve into the specifics. Imagine we have the following limited yet crucial pieces of information:\n\nDistribution of Substance \\(x\\): The expression levels of substance \\(x\\) in people follow a normal distribution.\nImpact on Longevity: Individuals at the high end of the expression spectrum tend to live approximately 5 years longer than those at the low end.\n\nGiven these insights, our task is to calculate a sample size that can yield statistically significant results. This endeavor will not only help us test our hypothesis with precision but also pave the way for future research that could revolutionize our understanding of genetic influences on lifespan. Let’s proceed with this vital calculation, knowing that the outcomes will bring us one step closer to potentially groundbreaking discoveries in genetic biomarkers and longevity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven this information, how many individuals should we include in our study to have a reasonable chance of demonstrating this hypothesis is correct? (I.e., What is the sample size?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWait, I have no idea how to answer this?\n\n\n\n\nDon’t worry!\nThe goal of this unit is to teach you to tackle this problem.\nLet’s first come up with any approach to compute a sample size, even if we’re not confident in the results.\n\nA few possible places to start:\n\nTake an educated guess: Perhaps you have taken part in or read about similar research before. What order of magnitude seems right for this sort of experiment?\nFind a source: Sample size estimation is a common topic in introductory statistics textbooks. These often include formulas that students can use to compute sample size for specific categories of questions.\nGoogle it: There are many web-based resources (including online calculators) that are designed to enable sample size calculations. Search engines provide a starting point for finding such resource Doing so, you might end up at a website like this or like this.\n\nOr, if you’d like to skip this step, we’ll suggest a sample size of 100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, try to estimate the sample size using one of these approaches. What obstacles did you encounter along the way? (NOTE: This isn’t always easy or obvious, even for veteran researchers!)\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a good video of the challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the description of the scientific hypothesis and experiment, think about what data you would collect and what analyses you would perform to test the hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\nWhat types of values do you expect for each variable? What are their distributions, do you think?\nHow do you expect the variables to be related?\nTry drawing a sketch of what you imagine a successful result might look like?\n(Text) For each participant, we will collect expression levels of substance \\(x\\) and age at death.\n(Text) I expect age at death to increase with \\(x\\).\n(Multiple Choice) Show different plots of \\(x\\) versus age at death, and ask learner to select the plot most consistent with the hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe provided very little information and asked you to compute the sample size. What other information do you think would be helpful to estimate the sample size?"
