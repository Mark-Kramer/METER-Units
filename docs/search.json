    "text": "Inference is a fundamental concept in both everyday life and scientific investigation. It is the process of drawing conclusions based on evidence and reasoning. Inference allows us to make predictions, understand relationships, and gain insights from data and observations.\n\n\n\n\nDecision-Making: Inference helps us make informed decisions. Whether you’re deciding what to wear based on the weather forecast or determining the best strategy for your experiment, inference plays a crucial role in evaluating options and outcomes.\nUnderstanding Brain Function: Inference helps neuroscientists draw conclusions about brain activity from experimental data, bridging the gap between observed neural signals and underlying brain processes.\nClinical Applications: Inference is essential for diagnosing and treating neurological disorders. By analyzing patient data, clinicians can infer the underlying causes of symptoms and tailor treatments accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeather Predictions: Meteorologists use data from satellites, weather stations, and historical patterns to infer future weather conditions. This helps us prepare for what’s coming, whether it’s bringing an umbrella or planning for a sunny day.\nMedical Diagnoses: Doctors use symptoms, medical history, and test results to infer the most likely cause of a patient’s condition. This process is critical in providing accurate diagnoses and effective treatments.\nElectrophysiology: Recording electrical activity from neurons allows researchers to infer the roles of specific neurons or networks in processing information.\nBehavioral Studies: By observing behavior in response to stimuli, neuroscientists infer the neural mechanisms underlying perception, decision-making, and learning.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we focus on statistical inference - using data from a sample to make inferences about a population. We will learn to apply statistical inference in this Unit.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk Questions: Cultivate curiosity by asking questions about the world around you. Why did something happen? What might influence this happening? Asking questions leads to deeper understanding and better inference skills.\nGather Evidence: Collect relevant information and data. The more evidence you have, the stronger your inferences will be. Evaluate the quality and reliability of your sources. We can arrive at better conclusions through better data collection.\nThink Critically: Analyze the evidence and consider multiple perspectives. Avoid jumping to conclusions without thorough examination. Critical thinking helps in making sound inferences.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this Unit, we will practice making inferences from from noisy data.\nTo do so, we will use data from a specific example. We will build models from these data to make inferences about a population (i.e., statistical inference).\nWe will think critically about our inference results, ask questions about the interpretation (i.e., check our model), and update our model to improve the inferences we make from the data."

    "text": "Step 3. Summarize conclusions.\nHaving chosen the model (Step 1) and inferred model parameters (Step 2), our last step is to summarize the conclusions of our statistical inference.\nLet’s start by considering an explict numerical conclusion from our model:\n\nHow does the number of drownings change if we increase the number of swim lessons by 1000?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe find an increase of 0.0014 drownings for a one-unit increase in the number of swim_lessons. How does the number of drownings change when the number of swim_lessons increases by 1000.\n\n\n\nA:\nOur model of the data is a line:\ndrownings = m swim_lessons + b\nWe inferred the model parameter m from the data and found:\ndrownings = 0.0014 swim_lessons + b\nConsider what happens if the number of swim lessons increases by 1. Then, according to our fit model, the number of drownings increases by:\ndrownings = 0.0014 * 1 = 0.0014\nThat’s a small increase, in both the number of swim lessons and number of drownings.\nAlternately, consider what happens if the number of swim lessons increases by 1000. Then, plugging into our model, we find the number of drownings increases by:\ndrownings = 0.0014 * 1000 = 1.4\nThat’s perhaps a more interpertable result; a community making a policy decision to promote more swim lessons (e.g., through subsidies, though advertisements) might expect 1 more drowning.\nIn this way, we can always interpert the results of a model. It’s often useful to plug in values, and see what happens.\n\n\n\nSummary\nWe’ve applied a statistical inference approach and found a compelling result:\n\nThe number of drowings increases with more swim lessons.\n\nThe slope estimate m in our model looks convincing:\n\nThe standard error is small (0.0002) compared to the slope (0.0014); i.e., the estimate is precise.\n\nThese results are certainly passable for peer-reviewed publication and perhaps enough to motivate a new public policy:\n\nTo prevent drownings, discourage swim lessons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s our next step?\n\n\n\nCENTER generated Button: These results are convincing - let’s advocate for change!\n\nDiscussion: That’s a reasonable conclusion, based on the evidence we’ve looked at so far. However, our conclusion is controversial: to reduce drownings, reduce the number of swim lessons. Before we recommend this policy, let’s investigate an essential aspect of our inference - how well our model (the line) fits the data. A good fit to the data inspires confidence in our inference. Alternatively, a poor fit provides us motivation to continue developing our model. Continue on to the next Mini to learn a strategey to answer this question.\n\nCENTER generate Button: I’m not sure yet!\n\nDiscussion: I’m glad you’re not sure. Neither am I. Our results suggest a controverisal conclusion: to reduce drownings, reduce the number of swim lessons. To make this conclusion, we modeled the data as a line. But, is this line a good model of the data? If so, that inspires confidence in our result. However, if the model (a line) is not a good representation of the data, then we might question the result. Continue on to the next Mini to learn a strategey to answer this question."

    "text": "Based on the groundbreaking research previously conducted in your lab, you and your collaborators have formulated a compelling scientific hypothesis: substance \\(x\\) could be a genetic biomarker for longevity, potentially influencing the age at which individuals pass away. This intriguing hypothesis opens up a new frontier in our understanding of genetics and lifespan, promising significant advancements in the field.\nBefore we can embark on an experimental journey to test the predictive power of this novel biomarker, we must first tackle a critical step: determining the appropriate sample size for a follow-up research study. The sample size is not just a number; it is a cornerstone of experimental design that ensures our data will be robust enough to support or refute our hypothesis.\nTo accurately compute this sample size, we need to consider our prior beliefs and existing knowledge about substance \\(x\\) and its relationship to longevity. Let’s delve into the specifics. Imagine we have the following limited yet crucial pieces of information:\n\nDistribution of Substance \\(x\\): The expression levels of substance \\(x\\) in people follow a normal distribution.\nImpact on Longevity: Individuals at the high end of the expression spectrum tend to live approximately 5 years longer than those at the low end.\n\nGiven these insights, our task is to calculate a sample size that can yield statistically significant results. This endeavor will not only help us test our hypothesis with precision but also pave the way for future research that could revolutionize our understanding of genetic influences on lifespan. Let’s proceed with this vital calculation, knowing that the outcomes will bring us one step closer to potentially groundbreaking discoveries in genetic biomarkers and longevity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven this information, how many individuals should we include in our study to have a reasonable chance of demonstrating this hypothesis is correct? (I.e., What is the sample size?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWait, I have no idea how to answer this?\n\n\n\n\nDon’t worry!\nThe goal of this unit is to teach you to tackle this problem.\nLet’s first come up with any approach to compute a sample size, even if we’re not confident in the results.\n\nA few possible places to start:\n\nTake an educated guess: Perhaps you have taken part in or read about similar research before. What order of magnitude seems right for this sort of experiment?\nFind a source: Sample size estimation is a common topic in introductory statistics textbooks. These often include formulas that students can use to compute sample size for specific categories of questions.\nGoogle it: There are many web-based resources (including online calculators) that are designed to enable sample size calculations. Search engines provide a starting point for finding such resource Doing so, you might end up at a website like this or like this.\n\nOr, if you’d like to skip this step, we’ll suggest a sample size of 100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt you estimated the sample size, what obstacles did you encounter along the way?\n\n\n\n\nSample size calculations aren’t always easy or obvious, even for veteran researchers!\nHere’s a good video of the challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the description of the scientific hypothesis and experiment, think about what data you would collect and what analyses you would perform to test the hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\nWhat types of values do you expect for each variable? What are their distributions, do you think?\nHow do you expect the variables to be related?\nTry drawing a sketch of what you imagine a successful result might look like?\n(Text) For each participant, we will collect expression levels of substance \\(x\\) and age at death.\n(Text) I expect age at death to increase with \\(x\\).\n(Multiple Choice) Show different plots of \\(x\\) versus age at death, and ask learner to select the plot most consistent with the hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe provided very little information and asked you to compute the sample size. What other information do you think would be helpful to estimate the sample size?"
