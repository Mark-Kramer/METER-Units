    "text": "Introduction\n\nYou work in a sleep lab studying the effect of a new treatment regimen on memory consolidation during sleep.\nYour lab collects an EEG biomarker of memory (sleep spindles) from N=20 human subjects.\nTo do so, your lab measures the power in the spindle band (9-15 Hz) twice per minute. Your lab has a reliable method to detect spindle activity; this detector is known to have small measurement errors outside of treatment. You expect it to still work during treatment, but also expect more variability in the spindle power estimates (hence more variability in the detections) during treatment.\nFor each subject, your lab measures spindle activity during three conditions:\n\nBaseline: Data collection lasts 7 hours while the subject sleeps the night before the intervention. This results in 840 samples of spindle activity for each subject.\nDuring Treatment: Data collection during a 15 minute intervention during sleep, resulting in 30 samples of spindle activity for each subject.\nPost-treatment: Data collection after intervention lasts 7 hours, while the subject sleeps, resulting in 840 samples of spindle activity for each subject.\n\n\nHere’s a graphical representation of the data collected from one subject: \nYour PI says: “I hypothesize that some subjects will show an increase in spindle activity as a result of this treatment. Other subjects may not respond to the treatment. Conduct a hypothesis test for each subject to determine if they are responsive and report the p-values associated with each test.”"

We cover this topic in detail in the Multiplicity Unit.\nHere we’ll chose a specific approach to deal with multiplicity - we’ll apply a Bonferroni correction. The Bonferroni correction reduces the Type I error rate by dividing the desired overall significance level (here 0.05) by the number of tests performed (here 20 tests, one test per subject). Stated simply, the Bonferroni test adjusts the significance level by dividing it by the number of tests we perform. Doing so reduces the risk of false positives (Type I errors); or more information, see Multiplicity Unit.\nSo, for our analysis of the p-values from 20 subjects, let’s compare the p-values to a stricter threshold of\np &lt; 0.05 / 20 or p &lt; 0.0025\nThresholding in this way provides a binary, yes/no answer to the question: do we have evidence that the spindle activity during treatment differs from 0?\nLet’s plot the p-values versus this new threhsold.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the Bonferroni correction, can we reject the null hypothesis for any subject?\n\n\n\n\n No. None of the p-values are less than 0.05/20.

    "text": "Inference is a fundamental concept in both everyday life and scientific investigation. It is the process of drawing conclusions based on evidence and reasoning. Inference allows us to make predictions, understand relationships, and gain insights from data and observations.\n\n\n\n\nDecision-Making: Inference helps us make informed decisions. Whether you’re deciding what to wear based on the weather forecast or determining the best strategy for your experiment, inference plays a crucial role in evaluating options and outcomes.\nUnderstanding Brain Function: Inference helps neuroscientists draw conclusions about brain activity from experimental data, bridging the gap between observed neural signals and underlying brain processes.\nClinical Applications: Inference is essential for diagnosing and treating neurological disorders. By analyzing patient data, clinicians can infer the underlying causes of symptoms and tailor treatments accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeather Predictions: Meteorologists use data from satellites, weather stations, and historical patterns to infer future weather conditions. This helps us prepare for what’s coming, whether it’s bringing an umbrella or planning for a sunny day.\nMedical Diagnoses: Doctors use symptoms, medical history, and test results to infer the most likely cause of a patient’s condition. This process is critical in providing accurate diagnoses and effective treatments.\nElectrophysiology: Recording electrical activity from neurons allows researchers to infer the roles of specific neurons or networks in processing information.\nBehavioral Studies: By observing behavior in response to stimuli, neuroscientists infer the neural mechanisms underlying perception, decision-making, and learning.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we focus on statistical inference - using data from a sample to make inferences about a population. We will learn to apply statistical inference in this Unit.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk Questions: Cultivate curiosity by asking questions about the world around you. Why did something happen? What might influence this happening? Asking questions leads to deeper understanding and better inference skills.\nGather Evidence: Collect relevant information and data. The more evidence you have, the stronger your inferences will be. Evaluate the quality and reliability of your sources. We can arrive at better conclusions through better data collection.\nThink Critically: Analyze the evidence and consider multiple perspectives. Avoid jumping to conclusions without thorough examination. Critical thinking helps in making sound inferences.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this Unit, we will practice making inferences from from noisy data.\nTo do so, we will use data from a specific example. We will build models from these data to make inferences about a population (i.e., statistical inference).\nWe will think critically about our inference results, ask questions about the interpretation (i.e., check our model), and update our model to improve the inferences we make from the data."

How does the number of drownings change when the number of swim_lessons increases by 1000.\n\n\n\nAnswer:\nOur model of the data is a line:\ndrownings = m swim_lessons + b\nWe inferred the model parameter m from the data and found:\ndrownings = 0.0014 swim_lessons + b\nConsider what happens if the number of swim lessons increases by 1. According to our fit model, the number of drownings increases by:\n\\(0.0014 * 1\\) swim lesson \\(= 0.0014\\)\nThat’s a small increase, in both the number of swim lessons and number of drownings.\nAlternately, consider what happens if the number of swim lessons increases by 1000. Plugging into our model, we find the number of drownings increases by:\n\\(0.0014 * 1000\\) swim lessons \\(= 1.4\\)\nThat’s perhaps a more interpertable result; a community making a policy decision to promote more swim lessons (e.g., through subsidies, though advertisements) might expect 1 more drowning.\nIn this way, we can always interpert the results of a model. It’s often useful to plug in values, and see what happens.\n\n\n\nSummary\nWe’ve applied a statistical inference approach and found a compelling result:\n\nThe number of drowings increases with more swim lessons.\n\nThe slope estimate m in our model looks convincing:\n\nThe standard error is small (0.0002) compared to the slope (0.0014); i.e., the estimate is precise.\n\nThese results are certainly passable for peer-reviewed publication and perhaps enough to motivate a new public policy:\n\nTo prevent drownings, discourage swim lessons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s our next step?\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results are convincing - let’s advocate for change!\n\n\nI’m not sure yet!"

Even if the initial statistcal inference proposed an intuitive result (i.e., that more swim_lessons decrease the number of drownings), we would still continue model development; when the model check fails, we’re not satisified with the initial model, no matter the intuitive appeal of the result."

    "text": "Based on the groundbreaking research previously conducted in your lab, you and your collaborators have formulated a compelling scientific hypothesis: substance \\(x\\) could be a genetic biomarker for longevity, potentially influencing the age at which individuals pass away. This intriguing hypothesis opens up a new frontier in our understanding of genetics and lifespan, promising significant advancements in the field.\nBefore we can embark on an experimental journey to test the predictive power of this novel biomarker, we must first tackle a critical step: determining the appropriate sample size for a follow-up research study. The sample size is not just a number; it is a cornerstone of experimental design that ensures our data will be robust enough to support or refute our hypothesis.\nTo accurately compute this sample size, we need to consider our prior beliefs and existing knowledge about substance \\(x\\) and its relationship to longevity. Let’s delve into the specifics. Imagine we have the following limited yet crucial pieces of information:\n\nDistribution of Substance \\(x\\): The expression levels of substance \\(x\\) in people follow a normal distribution.\nImpact on Longevity: Individuals at the high end of the expression spectrum tend to live approximately 5 years longer than those at the low end.\n\nGiven these insights, our task is to calculate a sample size that can yield statistically significant results. This endeavor will not only help us test our hypothesis with precision but also pave the way for future research that could revolutionize our understanding of genetic influences on lifespan. We will see that the sample size required to generate data that can support a scientific hypothesis depends directly on the prior beliefs and knowledge about that hypothesis. Let’s proceed with this vital calculation, knowing that the outcomes will bring us one step closer to potentially groundbreaking discoveries in genetic biomarkers and longevity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven this information, from how many individuals do we need to collect data to have a reasonable chance of demonstrating this hypothesis is correct?

What order of magnitude seems right for this sort of experiment?\nFind a source: Sample size estimation is a common topic in introductory statistics textbooks. These often include formulas that students can use to compute sample size for specific categories of questions.\nGoogle it: There are many web-based resources (including online calculators) that are designed to enable sample size calculations. Search engines provide a starting point for finding such resource Doing so, you might end up at a website like this or like this.\n\nOr, if you’d like to skip this step, we’ll suggest a sample size of 100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt you estimated the sample size, what obstacles did you encounter along the way?\n\n\n\n\nSample size calculations aren’t always easy or obvious, even for veteran researchers!\nHere’s a good video of the challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the description of the scientific hypothesis and experiment, think about what data you would collect and what analyses you would perform to test the hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\nWhat types of values do you expect for each variable? What are their distributions, do you think?\nHow do you expect the variables to be related?\nTry drawing a sketch of what you imagine a successful result might look like?\n(Text) For each participant, we will collect expression levels of substance \\(x\\) and age at death.\n(Text) I expect age at death to increase with \\(x\\).\n(Multiple Choice) Show different plots of \\(x\\) versus age at death, and ask learner to select the plot most consistent with the hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe provided very little information and asked you to compute the sample size.

The plot will be jagged, but you’ll get the idea.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe find that the statistical power increases with N_resampled.\nLarger samples provide more information about the population, leading to more precise estimates of the population parameters. This precision reduces the standard error and widens the gap between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis if there is a true effect, making it easier to detect significant differences. Therefore, increasing the sample size typically increases the power of a statistical test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAside: Why do we choose statistical power 0.8?\n\n\n\nChoosing a statistical power of 0.8, or 80%, is a common convention in many fields of research, particularly in the social and biomedical sciences.\nStatistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis, thus avoiding a Type II error. A power of 0.8 means there is a 20% chance of a Type II error (failing to detect a true effect). Setting the power at 0.8 provides a reasonable balance between the risks of Type I errors (false positives) and Type II errors (false negatives). Researchers often choose a 5% (alpha=0.05) significance level for Type I errors, aiming to maintain a pragmatic yet cautious approach to declaring findings.\nIncreasing power beyond 0.8 generally requires larger sample sizes, which can escalate the costs and logistical complexity of a study. The choice of 0.8 is considered a good trade-off between increasing precision and controlling operational constraints.\nThe 0.8 level has become somewhat of a standard through historical precedent and its endorsement in statistical texts and guidelines. Researchers often follow these conventions to align with accepted practices, making their studies comparable to others in the field."

We’ll accept a higher risk of rejecting the null hypothesis when it’s actually true (i.e., a higher Type I error).\nAt this looser threshold for significance, it’s easier to declare a result significant. But, the risk of false positives increases - more results will appear significant, but more could be false.\n\n\n\nTo study the impact of increasing alpha on the statistical power, let’s compute it.\nWe’ll do so using a sample size N_resampled=100.

Can we get the statistical power we want (0.8) at a low sample size?\nNo, we did not find a loophole.\nWhat we’ve discovered is a fundamental tradeoff in hypothesis testing: you can increase statistical power by increasing alpha, but at a cost.\nStatistical power depends on sample size and the signficance threshold (alpha).\nBy setting alpha=0.75, we’re saying:\n\nI’m willing to reject the null hypothesis 75% of the time even when it is true.\n\nThis results in:\n\nVery high false positive rate (Type I error = 75%)\nArtificially inflated power (since it’s now very easy to reject the null)\nA test that’s statistically meaningless by conventional standards\n\nIt’s like lowering the bar so much that everyone passes the test. Sure, your “pass rate” (power) goes up—but the test no longer distinguishes between those who know the material and those who don’t.\nSo, did we find a loophole?\nNo! We can always increase power by increasing alpha, but that destroys the credibility of our findings. At alpha=0.75 there is a very high probability of being a false positive."

    "text": "EXTRA! EXTRA! RAT BRAINS CRACK THE STOCK MARKET CODE!\nIn a dazzling demonstration of rodent ingenuity—or perhaps sheer luck—researchers have harnessed the firing neurons of rat motor cortices to predict movements in the U.S. stock market. That’s right, folks! A team from Michigan and Georgia linked rat brain activity to Wall Street ticker tapes, proving that whiskers may rival Wall Street wits. By monitoring the firing rates of 94 neurons across three rats, these scientists uncovered correlations between neural activity and the daily closing prices of stocks on NASDAQ, the NYSE, and the American Stock Exchange. The Coca-Cola stock price, for instance, danced in sync with the neurons like Fred and Ginger at the Ziegfeld Follies.\nBut wait, there’s more! The researchers didn’t stop at finding patterns — they dove headfirst into the trading floor with a predictive model based on neural firing rates. Rats’ neural spikes gave the orders: buy, sell, or hold. And the results? An impressive 43% increase in a simulated portfolio value, turning an initial $$$1,000 investment into a snappy $$$1,435 over just 20 trading days. Forget the contrarian strategies of hedge fund honchos—our furry friends seem to have cracked the code.\nAnd here’s the kicker, folks: this isn’t just about making a buck. The findings suggest a mysterious connection between rat neural activity and human economic behavior. The researchers propose a grand theory linking the creatures of Earth to the ebbs and flows of societal urges, tying their work to theories like Gaia’s interconnected organism hypothesis. So, the next time someone says, “it’s a rat race out there,” remember—they might just be running the show!"

    "text": "That’s quite a story …\nUsing noisy data recorded from rodent brains, the authors found a relationship between neural activity and stock prices. At first glance, these results may seem consistent with well-established observations that neural activity encodes a rodent’s location in its world citation. However, you might also be (reasonably) skeptical. How could neural activity from a rat brain possibly predict the stock price of Coca-Cola?\nIn what follows, we’ll investigate this question and see how multiplicity can produce spurious results.\n\nQ: When exploring data, the number of relationships between the things you observe increases quickly with the number of observed items. To get a sense for this, consider observations from N neurons (e.g., spiking activity) and M signals (e.g., stock prices). How many possible combinations of relationships exist between the neurons and signals?\nA: N*M\nInterpretation: That number can get very big with modern data observations! How do you decide which of these comparisons are meaningful?\n\n\nQ: In the article discused above (Stock Market Behavior Predicted by Rat Neurons, Annals of Improbable Research), activity from 94 neurons was compared with activity from 4195 stocks. How many possible combinations of relationships exist between the neurons and stock signals?\nA: 94*4195 = 381,745\nInterpretation: That’s a lot of relationships to examine! How do you decide which of these comparisons are meaningful?"

    "text": "To build some intuition for these steps, let’s start with a simple example.\nConsider an experiment in which you perform 5 hypothesis tests (\\(m=5\\)) and collect 5 p-values:\np-value: [0.1, 0.12, 0.001, 0.03, 0.045]\nWe conducted 5 tests, and decide to correct for multiplicity.\nLet’s use the p-values to perform each step of the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.\n\nQ: To start, order the p-values from smallest to largest.\nA: [0.001, 0.015, 0.045, 0.1, 0.12]\n\n\nQ: Then, perform Step 1. Assign each p-value a rank.\nA: p-value, Rank\n0.001, \\(r=1\\)\n0.015, \\(r=2\\)\n0.045, \\(r=3\\)\n0.1, \\(r=4\\)\n0.12, \\(r=5\\)\n\n\nQ: Next, perform Step 2. Calculate the critical value.\nA: The critical value for each p-value is \\((r / m) \\cdot q\\). We choose \\(q=0.05\\), which is the standard choice, and indicates that, on average, no more than 5% of the rejected hypotheses are expected to be false positives.\nThe critical values for each rank are then:\nRank, Critical values\n1, (1/5)*0.05 = 0.01\n2, (2/5)*0.05 = 0.02\n3, (3/5)*0.05 = 0.03\n4, (4/5)*0.05 = 0.04\n5, (5/5)*0.05 = 0.05\n\n\nQ: Perform Step 3. Compare each p-value to its corresponding critical value.\nA: Let’s do this for each p-value, starting from the smallest p-value:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np-value\nCritical value\nIs p-value less than critical value\nSignificant?\n\n\n\n\n0.001\n(1/5)*0.05 = 0.01\nYes\nsignificant\n\n\n0.015\n(2/5)*0.05 = 0.02\nYes\nsignificant\n\n\n0.045\n(3/5)*0.05 = 0.03\nNo\nnot significant\n\n\n0.1\n(4/5)*0.05 = 0.04\nNo\nnot significant\n\n\n0.12\n(5/5)*0.05 = 0.05\nNo\nnot significant\n\n\n\nThus, p-values of 0.001 and 0.015 are considered significant under an FDR threshold of 5%. The p-values of 0.045, 0.1, 0.12 do not meet the significance threshold in this analysis.\n\n\nQ: In this illustrative example, we found two p-values are considered significant using the FDR procedure. What would you find if you instead used a Bonferroni correction?\nA: For the Bonferroni correction, we use the same threshold 0.05/5 = 0.01 for each comparison:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np-value\nCritical value\nIs p-value less than critical value\nSignificant?\n\n\n\n\n0.001\n(1/5)*0.05 = 0.01\nYes\nsignificant\n\n\n0.03\n(1/5)*0.05 = 0.01\nNo\nnot significant\n\n\n0.045\n(1/5)*0.05 = 0.01\nNo\nnot significant\n\n\n0.1\n(1/5)*0.05 = 0.01\nNo\nnot significant\n\n\n0.12\n(1/5)*0.05 = 0.01\nNo\nnot significant\n\n\n\nWe now find that only one p-values (0.001) is considered significant under a Bonferroni correction.\n\nNow, having built some intuition for computing the FDR using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure, let’s apply it to our data of interest.\nIt’s the same idea, but instead of considering 5 p-values, we must consider the 20,000 p-values.\n\np_values_signficant_after_FDR = fdr(p)\n\nThe function fdr returns whether each p-value in p remains signficant after correcting for multiplicity using FDR.\nLet’s display the p-values that remain significant after correcting for multiplicity using FDR:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(20, 8))\ncmap = ListedColormap(['white', 'red'])\nplt.imshow(p_values_signficant_after_FDR, cmap=cmap)\nplt.xlabel('Neuron number'); plt.ylabel('Signal number');\n\n\nQ: Examine the figure above. Do you see any red dots, indicating significant relationships between neurons and signals after correcting for multiplicity using FDR?\nA: There are two red dots, between:\n“Signal 0” and “Neuron 0” – i.e., the first signal and first neuron.\n“Signal 0” and “Neuron 24” – i.e., the first signal and 25th neuron.\n\n\nInterpretation:\n\nWe originally corrected for multiplicity using the Bonferroni correction. Following this strict correction, we found no evidence of significanet associations spikes and signals.\nAfter correcting for multiplicity using FDR, we now find two neurons in the rat brain are associated with the same signal (“Signal 0”).\nWe return to our collaborators and they confirm that “Signal 0” corresponds to the rodent’s position.\n\n\n\nRelief\n\nWe’ve corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR and find a sensible result.\nThe results are consistent with the existing theory that neuron’s in the brain encode rodent position.\nWe find no evidence that neurons in the rodent brain predict stock market prices.\nUsing a less strict correction (FDR instead of Bonferroni) we identify significant associations in the data."
