    "- You work in a sleep lab studying the effect of a new treatment regimen on memory consolidation during sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your lab collects an EEG biomarker of memory ([sleep spindles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_spindle)) from N=20 human subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To do so, your lab measures the [power](https://mark-kramer.github.io/Case-Studies-Python/03.html) in the spindle band (9-15 Hz) twice per minute. Your lab has a [reliable method](https://mark-kramer.github.io/Case-Studies-Python/04.html#multitaper) to detect spindle activity; this detector is known to have small measurement errors outside of treatment. You expect it to still work during treatment, but also expect more variability in the spindle power estimates (hence more variability in the detections) during treatment.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- For each subject, your lab measures spindle activity during three conditions:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Baseline**: Data collection lasts 7 hours while the subject sleeps the night before the intervention. This results in 840 samples of spindle activity for each subject.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **During Treatment**: Data collection during a 15 minute intervention during sleep, resulting in 30 samples of spindle activity for each subject.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Post-treatment**: Data collection after intervention lasts 7 hours, while the subject sleeps, resulting in 840 samples of spindle activity for each subject.\n",

This risks throwing away useful information and decreasing the statistical power of an argument. "

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does a p-value mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "A p-value is used to compare two competing hypotheses. If our scientific hypothesis is that spindle activity changes during treatment relative to its baseline level of activity, we need another hypothesis to compare this to. In this case, we can hypothesize that the spindle activity does not change during treatment.  This is called the **null hypothesis**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to collect data that provides evidence in favor of our scientific hypothesis over the null hypothesis. But this is not a fair fight; we start by assuming that the null hypothesis is true and only reject it after we achieve a sufficiently high bar of evidence. The p-value tells us how high a bar we have achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful analogy is proof by contradiction. There, we assume that a hypothesis is true and show that this assumption leads to a contraction. If we were to observe data that could not possibly occur if the null hypothesis were true, this would be definitive evidence against that hypothesis. However, it is not the case that if we observe data that is unlikely if the null hypothesis were true then the null hypothesis is itself unlikely.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, most people would agree with the following statement, \"If a person is American, they probably are not the US President.” Now imagine that we select an individual at random and they happen to be the US President. It is clearly not the case that this individual is probably not American. While the observation that this individual is the US president is unlikely under the null hypothesis that this individual is American, it is much more unlikely (or impossible) under the alternate hypothesis that they are not American.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful analogy is to a prosecutor at a trial. In this analogy, the null hypothesis is akin to the hypothesis that the defendant is innocent. The court assumes that defendant is innocent until proven guilty. The prosecutor tries to amass and present evidence to demonstrate that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. A strong argument needs to include evidence that would be unlikely to occur if the hypothesis that the defendant is innocent is true, and more likely to occur if the hypothesis that the defendant is guilty is true. If the prosecutor fails to provide sufficient evidence that the defendant is guilty, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they are innocent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statistical test, the p-value indicates how surprising our evidence would be if the null hypothesis were true. For our problem, if we're sufficiently surprised by the observed data, then we'll reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that we have evidence that the spindle activity changes relative to baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if we're not surprised by the observed data, then we'll conclude that we lack sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. There's an important subtlety here that statisicians like to point out - when we're testing this way, **we never accept the null hypothesis**. Instead, the best we can do is talk like a statistician and say things like *\"We fail to reject the null hypothesis\"*. In our court analogy, this is equivalent to finding the defendant not guilty rather than innocent, because we realize that it is possible that defendant committed the crime but we lacked the evidence to convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n",
