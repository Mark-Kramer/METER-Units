    "## EXTRA! EXTRA! RAT BRAINS CRACK THE STOCK MARKET CODE!\n",
    "\n",
    "In a dazzling demonstration of rodent ingenuity—or perhaps sheer luck—[researchers have harnessed the firing neurons of rat motor cortices to predict movements in the U.S. stock market](https://improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume12/v12i4/rats-12-4.pdf). That’s right, folks! A team from Michigan and Georgia linked rat brain activity to Wall Street ticker tapes, proving that whiskers may rival Wall Street wits. By monitoring the firing rates of 94 neurons across three rats, these scientists uncovered correlations between neural activity and the daily closing prices of stocks on NASDAQ, the NYSE, and the American Stock Exchange. The Coca-Cola stock price, for instance, danced in sync with the neurons like Fred and Ginger at the Ziegfeld Follies.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, there’s more! The researchers didn’t stop at finding patterns — they dove headfirst into the trading floor with a predictive model based on neural firing rates. Rats’ neural spikes gave the orders: buy, sell, or hold. And the results? An impressive 43% increase in a simulated portfolio value, turning an initial $\\$$1,000 investment into a snappy $\\$$1,435 over just 20 trading days. Forget the contrarian strategies of hedge fund honchos—our furry friends seem to have cracked the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "And here’s the kicker, folks: this isn’t just about making a buck. The findings suggest a mysterious connection between rat neural activity and human economic behavior. The researchers propose a grand theory linking the creatures of Earth to the ebbs and flows of societal urges, tying their work to theories like Gaia’s interconnected organism hypothesis. So, the next time someone says, “it’s a rat race out there,” remember—they might just be running the show!"

The BH procedure is a statistical method to control the false discovery rate (FDR) in multiple hypothesis testing. It ranks the p-values from smallest to largest and compares each to a threshold that increases with rank, defined as $(r/m) \\cdot q$, where $r$ is the rank of the p-value (i.e., the p-values position when ordered from smallest to largest), $m$ is the total number of tests, and $q$ is the desired FDR level, which is the expected proportion of false positives among all rejected hypotheses. For example, if $q = 0.05$, it means that, on average, no more than 5% of the rejected hypotheses are expected to be false positives. This allows for a controlled balance between identifying true effects and limiting false discoveries in multiple hypothesis testing.\n",

    "1. **Assign each p-value a rank**, $r$, where the smallest p-value has rank $r=1$, the next smallest has rank $r=2$, and so on.\n",
