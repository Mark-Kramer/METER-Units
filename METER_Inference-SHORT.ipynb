Investigating this model residuals revealed a poor model fit. We improved our model by adding another predictor - the distance to the ocean. Doing so changed our results dramatically: we now find a (weak) relationship between increasing swim lessons and decreasing drownings. However, our evidence for this relationship is not convincing (the p-value is large). We'll show in other units that continued model refinement can further strengthen this result. If you're interetsed, check out the other Minis associated with this Unit.\n",
